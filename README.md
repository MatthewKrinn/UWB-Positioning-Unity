# Contributions:

My first task was to implement a Kalman Filter to smooth human motion-tracking data from DW1000 modules. `player-filter` and `datahandler-filter` both contain working implementations, but the latter is more module and thus was the one chosen to be merged with `master`.

Then, I began exploring how multi-tag functionality could be implemented in `multitag`. Comments explain assumptions made during the process.
